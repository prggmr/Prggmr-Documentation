<h2>
    Prggmr the Framework
</h2>
<p>
    The Prggmr framework is the fruit of 3 years of continuous development, researching, mistakes and enlightenment into
    software architectural patterns. The Prggmr framework has been a long-term goal that is finally achieved and I hope
    that everyone enjoys the framework as much as I enjoyed developing it.
